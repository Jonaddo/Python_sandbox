# About this repository
In this repository there are divers projects related to finance and other topics (more to come).

# MC_BS.py 
Here we have a simple example of a Monte Carlo simulation using the Euler scheme for the Black-Scholes model.

# MC_Heston.py
This is a simple example of a Monte Carlo simulation using the Euler scheme for the Heston model. The main difference with the previous example is that this time we allow the volatility to be stochastic.
