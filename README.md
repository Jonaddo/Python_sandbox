# About
In this repository there are a couple of exercises related to different topics.

# square_circle
Could be an interview question.
We imagine that we are asked to draw random dots in the corner of a square.
In addition, we have to draw a circle in this corner.
Finally, we have to color the dots in 2 different colors depending if they are in or out of the circle.

# Callprice_MC.py
Simple code to compute a call option price using the Monte-Carlo simulation in the BS framework.

# MC_BS.py 
Here we have a simple example of a Monte Carlo simulation using the Euler scheme for the Black-Scholes model.

# MC_Heston.py
This file is a simple example of a Monte Carlo simulation using the Heston model. The main difference with the previous example is that this time we allow the volatility to be stochastic and thus is more realistic for simulating for instance, stock prices.
